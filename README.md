## <b><ins> Description: </ins></b>
        
This is a program constructed with Javascript and utilizes both Node.js and MongoDB. It features usage of the Express.js, Mongoose.js packages to create a back-end API for an psuedo social media platform.
<br><br>      

## <b><ins> Installation: </ins></b>
        
The app is deployed on Heroku so it is not needed to install anything. If you would like to run it locally, please download [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) first. Please download all the files included in the repository. Afterwards, please open your terminal into the repository folder and utilize Node.js's npm install feature `npm i` to install all the used packages. Once that is completed run the seed script `npm run seed`.

## <b><ins> Usage: </ins></b>
        
To start the program, please make sure the MongoDB server is running by executing `mongod` in the terminal. Then open the directory on terminal and type in `npm start`. You will then be able to go to the proper routes to see the JSON information for the API.
